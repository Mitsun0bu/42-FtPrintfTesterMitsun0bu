Additional tests and makefile will be added later.  
To use it :  
1. Clone this repo in your own ft_printf folder.  
2. `make` your libftprintf.a library.  
3. Compile with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra *.c ./ft_printf_tester_Mitsun0bu/ft_printf_tester_Mitsun0bu.c libftprintf.a`.  
4. Run with `./a.out`.
